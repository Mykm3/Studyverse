# PDF.js Express Assets

This directory should contain the PDF.js Express WebViewer assets.

Please download the full viewer assets from [https://pdfjs.express/download](https://pdfjs.express/download) and extract them into this directory. The directory structure should look like this:

```
public/pdfjs-express/
├── core/
├── ui/
├── pdf/
├── webviewer.min.js
├── webviewer-core.min.js
├── webviewer-ui.min.js
└── ... other files and directories
```

After placing the assets here, restart your development server to see the changes take effect.
